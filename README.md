# 🌍 Travel Agency Page ✈️

This project, created by **Kelvin Newtype**, is a solution for the FreeCodeCamp HTML lab, the one directly after HTML Fundamentals. It showcases various travel packages and top itineraries, allowing for practice in HTML structure and semantics, following a set of specific user stories.

## 📝 User Stories

1. The page includes a DOCTYPE declaration.
2. The `html` element has the `lang` attribute set to "en".
3. The `head` element contains:
    - A `meta` element with `charset` set to "utf-8".
    - A `title` element with the text "Travel Agency Page".
4. An `h1` element presents the travel destinations.
5. A paragraph below the `h1` element introduces the travel opportunities.
6. An `h2` element with the text "Packages".
7. A paragraph introduces the various packages briefly.
8. An unordered list contains two list items:
    - "Group Travels" enclosed by an anchor element.
    - "Private Tours" enclosed by an anchor element.
9. An `h2` element with the text "Top Itineraries".
10. At least three `figure` elements, each containing:
    - An anchor element.
    - An `img` element with an appropriate `alt` attribute and a `src` attribute set to a valid image.
    - A `figcaption` element.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Copy the HTML code into an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`).
2. Open the file in a web browser to view the travel agency page.

Feel free to customize the page further to match your personal style or add additional features! 🌟
